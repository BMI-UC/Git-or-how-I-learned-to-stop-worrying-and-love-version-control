#+title: Git, or How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love Version Control

This is a presentation that I wrote to convince people in the program to use git
wherever possible.

The goal is not to teach how to use git, though there is some of that in here, but
more to convince the audience that git is worthwhile.
